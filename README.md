vague is a dark, low contrast theme inspired [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)'s use of [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) without fixing [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)'s colors.

Here's a preview of what that looks like in golang

## Installation

```lua
-- Lazy
{
  "vague2k/vague.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("vague").setup({
      -- optional configuration here
    })
  end
},
```

## Default configuration

```lua
require("vague").setup({
  transparent = false, -- don't set background
  style = {
    -- "none" is the same thing as default. But "italic" and "bold" are also valid options
    comments = "italic",
    conditionals = "none",
    functions = "none",
    keywords = "none",
    headings = "bold", -- markdown headings
    operators = "none",
    keyword_return = "none",
    strings = "italic",
    variables = "none",
  },
  -- These are the default colors, but they are overideable.
  -- Different highlights which may be non related share some colors, so expirement.
  colors = {
    bg = "#18191a",
    fg = "#cdcdcd",
    floatBorder = "#878787",
    line = "#282830",
    comment = "#646477",
    builtin = "#bad1ce",
    func = "#be8c8c",
    string = "#d7b797",
    number = "#d2a374",
    property = "#b4b4ce",

    error = "#d2788c",
    warning = "#e6be8c",
    hint = "#8ca0dc",
    operator = "#96a3b2",
    keyword = "#7894ab",
    type = "#a1b3b9",
    search = "#465362",
    -- used mostly in git related highlights
    plus = "#8faf77",
    delta = "#e6be8c",
  }
})
```

The structure of this code was shamelessly ripped off [neomodern](https://github.com/cdmill/neomodern.nvim) of which I used it's roseprime colorscheme for a very long time. I'd highly suggest you check it out.
